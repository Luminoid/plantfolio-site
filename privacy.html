            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 2026</p>

            <h2>Scope and Acceptance</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") governs the collection, use, disclosure, and retention of information in connection with the mobile application "Plantfolio Plus" (the "App"), operated by Chunhou Li ("we," "us," or "our").

If you do not agree to this Policy, you must not use the App.</p>

            <h2>Definitions</h2>
            <p>For the purposes of this Policy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Personal Data"</strong> means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.</li>
                <li><strong>"Processing"</strong> means any operation or set of operations performed on Personal Data (e.g., collection, storage, alteration, disclosure).</li>
                <li><strong>"Data Controller"</strong> means the natural or legal person who determines the purposes and means of Processing.</li>
                <li><strong>"User Data"</strong> means all data entered, generated, or stored by the User within the App, including without limitation plant data, photos, care records, collections, and settings.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Controller and Key Principle</h2>
            <p>The Data Controller in respect of Personal Data Processed in connection with the App is Chunhou Li. Correspondence may be sent to: <a href="mailto:diveintothefog@gmail.com">diveintothefog@gmail.com</a>. A physical address may be requested for legal or regulatory purposes by contacting the Data Controller at the foregoing email.</p>
            <p><strong>We do not operate any servers and do not store, retain, or Process any User Data on systems under our control.</strong> All User Data remains solely on the User’s device or, where the User has enabled iCloud sync, on infrastructure operated by Apple Inc. ("Apple") as part of the iCloud service (under the User’s Apple ID). We do not have access to, and do not receive or transmit, User Data.</p>

            <h2>1. Categories of Data Processed</h2>

            <h3>1.1 Data Provided by the User</h3>
            <p>In the course of using the App, the User may input or otherwise provide the following categories of data, which are Processed locally on the User’s device and, where iCloud sync is enabled, by Apple on behalf of the User:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Plant and collection data:</strong> Names, scientific names, plant types, descriptions, research notes, light and soil preferences, pot materials, seasonal watering schedules, and start dates.</li>
                <li><strong>Photographs:</strong> Images of plants or collections added to the App, with optional categorical labels (e.g., growth, flowers, problems).</li>
                <li><strong>Care records:</strong> Watering logs (dates and notes), growth measurements (height, width, notes), fertilization logs (type, NPK, dosage, method, notes), pruning logs (type, technique, notes), and watering rescheduling or postponement.</li>
                <li><strong>Collection structure:</strong> Grouping of plants into collections and membership of each plant in at most one collection.</li>
                <li><strong>App settings:</strong> Date format, language preference (e.g., English, Chinese, Spanish), notification preferences (enabled/disabled, reminder time), default sort and filter options, custom soil or pot types, and preference to hide archived plants.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.2 Data Obtained Automatically by the App</h3>
            <p>The following data may be obtained or derived by the App on the User’s device only; none of such data is transmitted to us:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Photo metadata:</strong> EXIF data (e.g., date taken) or the creation date of the photo asset may be read to populate date fields automatically. Such Processing occurs solely on the User’s device.</li>
                <li><strong>Date and season:</strong> The device’s date and calendar may be used to determine the current season (for watering schedules) and the current date for reminders and calendar views. No location or timezone data is transmitted to us.</li>
                <li><strong>Device information:</strong> Apple’s App Store and system services may collect information (e.g., iOS version, device model) in accordance with Apple’s policies. We do not use third-party analytics or tracking.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.3 Data Not Collected</h3>
            <p>We do not collect, and the App is not designed to collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personal identification information (name, email, physical address) except where voluntarily provided by the User when contacting us (e.g., support inquiries).</li>
                <li>Precise or approximate location data.</li>
                <li>Payment or financial information (the App does not process payments).</li>
                <li>Browsing history or activity outside the App.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Purposes and Legal Basis for Processing</h2>

            <h3>2.1 Purposes</h3>
            <p>User Data is Processed solely for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide and maintain the core functionality of the App (plant and collection management, calendar, watering schedules, photographs, care logs).</li>
                <li>To enable optional features such as watering reminders, calendar views, and plant organization.</li>
                <li>Where the User has enabled iCloud sync, to permit storage and synchronization of User Data across the User’s devices via Apple’s iCloud service. Such Processing is performed by Apple pursuant to the User’s Apple ID and Apple’s terms and privacy policy; we do not perform or control such Processing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Where the User contacts us for support (e.g., by email), we Process only the information contained in or attached to that communication for the purpose of responding to the inquiry.</p>

            <h3>2.2 Legal Basis (EEA / UK GDPR)</h3>
            <p>To the extent that Processing of Personal Data occurs in connection with the App, such Processing takes place only on the User’s device or on infrastructure operated by Apple (when iCloud sync is enabled). We do not Process Personal Data on systems under our control. Insofar as the App may be considered to Process Personal Data on the User’s device, the legal bases under the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and the UK GDPR are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Performance of a contract (Art. 6(1)(b)):</strong> Processing is necessary for the performance of the contract between the User and us (provision of the App and its core functionality).</li>
                <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a)):</strong> Where the User explicitly enables optional features such as iCloud sync or notifications, Processing is based on the User’s consent.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Storage and Security</h2>

            <h3>3.1 Location of Data</h3>
            <p>We do not store User Data. All User Data is held in one or both of the following locations only:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User’s device:</strong> User Data is stored locally on the User’s device using the SwiftData framework. Such data remains on the device and is not transmitted to us.</li>
                <li><strong>Apple iCloud (optional):</strong> Where the User has enabled iCloud sync, the App uses SwiftData’s CloudKit integration such that a copy of User Data is also stored on infrastructure operated by Apple (iCloud), associated with the User’s Apple ID. We do not have access to such data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.2 iCloud Synchronization</h3>
            <p>When iCloud sync is enabled, User Data may be stored on the User’s device and on Apple’s iCloud infrastructure. Such data is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Encrypted in transit and at rest by Apple’s iCloud service.</li>
                <li>Subject to Apple’s iCloud Terms and Conditions and Apple’s Privacy Policy.</li>
                <li>Accessible only to the User on devices signed in with the User’s Apple ID.</li>
                <li>Not accessible to us or to any third party under our control; we do not operate servers or store User Data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>iCloud sync is optional and may be disabled at any time via the App or the device’s system settings.</p>

            <h3>3.3 Technical and Organizational Measures</h3>
            <p>Security of User Data is determined by its storage location:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>On the User’s device: data is stored using iOS secure storage mechanisms (SwiftData).</li>
                <li>When iCloud sync is enabled: data is encrypted and stored on Apple’s iCloud infrastructure.</li>
                <li>No User Data is transmitted to us or to any system operated by us.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Third-Party Services and External Links</h2>

            <h3>4.1 Apple Services</h3>
            <p>The App integrates with the following services operated by Apple Inc.:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>App Store:</strong> Distribution and updates of the App. Apple may collect information in accordance with its Privacy Policy.</li>
                <li><strong>iCloud:</strong> Optional synchronization of User Data. When enabled, User Data is stored on the User’s device and on Apple’s iCloud infrastructure; we do not store such data.</li>
                <li><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> Delivery of watering reminders. Notification content is Processed by Apple’s notification services.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Apple’s Privacy Policy is available at: <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.apple.com/privacy/</a>. Users are encouraged to review it.</p>

            <h3>4.2 Export and Import</h3>
            <p>The App permits the User to export User Data (plants, collections, photos, watering and care logs, settings) to a ZIP file on the User’s device or to the Files app, and to import from a previously exported ZIP (replace all or merge). Export and import operations are performed solely on the User’s device or in locations selected by the User. We do not receive, store, or Process exported or imported data.</p>

            <h3>4.3 External Links and On-Device Reference Data</h3>
            <p>The App may contain links to third-party resources (e.g., Wikipedia) for plant care information. Accessing such links takes the User outside the App; the privacy practices and terms of those third parties apply. The App also includes built-in reference data (e.g., plant types and care information) stored locally on the device; such data is not used to identify the User.</p>

            <h2>5. Disclosure of Personal Data</h2>

            <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade Personal Data. We do not disclose User Data to third parties, except:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>With the User’s consent:</strong> When the User enables iCloud sync, User Data is stored on the User’s device and on Apple’s iCloud infrastructure pursuant to the User’s choice; we do not store or access such data.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal obligation:</strong> Where we are required by applicable law or by a valid legal process (e.g., court order, subpoena) to disclose information. Because we do not store User Data, we would have no such data to disclose unless the User has voluntarily provided it to us (e.g., in a support communication).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Data Subject Rights and Choices</h2>

            <h3>6.1 Access, Correction, Deletion, and Portability</h3>
            <p>Subject to applicable law, the User may:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access:</strong> View all User Data (plants, collections, photos, care records, settings) within the App.</li>
                <li><strong>Rectification:</strong> Edit, update, or delete plants, collections, photos, watering logs, growth measurements, fertilization and pruning logs, and settings at any time.</li>
                <li><strong>Erasure:</strong> Delete individual items or archive plants; uninstalling the App removes data stored locally on the device (data stored in iCloud remains until deleted by the User via Apple ID settings).</li>
                <li><strong>Data portability:</strong> Export a complete copy of User Data (plants, collections, photos, logs, settings) to a ZIP file from within the App; the exported file remains on the User’s device or in a location chosen by the User.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>6.2 Notification Preferences</h3>
            <p>Notifications may be enabled or disabled at any time via the App’s settings. Notification permissions may also be managed through the device’s system settings.</p>

            <h3>6.3 iCloud Data</h3>
            <p>Where iCloud sync is used, the User may manage iCloud data through Apple ID settings. iCloud sync may be disabled at any time via the App or the device’s system settings.</p>

            <h2>7. Minors</h2>

            <p>The App is not directed at minors. We do not knowingly collect or Process Personal Data from minors.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>United States (COPPA):</strong> We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under 13 years of age. We do not operate servers or store User Data; accordingly, we do not have access to or possession of any such data to delete. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child under 13 has used the App, you may remove all data by uninstalling the App from the device and, where iCloud sync was used, by deleting the relevant data from the child’s Apple ID / iCloud account.</li>
                <li><strong>European Economic Area / UK (GDPR):</strong> We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children below the age of 16 (or the applicable age of digital consent in the relevant jurisdiction, which may be lower). We do not operate servers or store User Data; accordingly, we do not have access to or possession of any such data to delete. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has used the App, you may remove all data by uninstalling the App from the device and, where iCloud sync was used, by managing or deleting the data in the child’s Apple ID / iCloud account.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. International Transfers</h2>

            <p>Where the User is located outside the United States and uses iCloud sync:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>User Data stored on Apple’s infrastructure may be stored or Processed in the United States or in other countries in which Apple operates.</li>
                <li>For Users in the European Economic Area ("EEA") or the United Kingdom, transfers of Personal Data to countries outside the EEA or UK may be subject to appropriate safeguards, including Apple’s adherence to Standard Contractual Clauses or other mechanisms approved by the European Commission or the UK authorities, and Apple’s participation in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework or UK extension where applicable.</li>
                <li>By enabling iCloud sync, the User acknowledges that User Data may be stored on Apple’s servers in accordance with the foregoing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We comply with applicable data protection legislation, including the GDPR where it applies.</p>

            <h2>9. California Privacy Rights (CCPA/CPRA)</h2>

            <p>If you are a California resident, you may have the right, under the California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act) and its implementing regulations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To know what Personal Information is collected, used, shared, or sold. We do not store or sell your Personal Information.</li>
                <li>To request deletion of your Personal Information. Because we do not store your data, deletion is effected by you (e.g., by deleting data in the App, uninstalling the App, or managing data in your Apple ID / iCloud settings).</li>
                <li>To opt out of the sale or sharing of Personal Information. We do not sell or share Personal Information.</li>

            <h2>10. EEA and UK Data Subject Rights (GDPR)</h2>

            <p>If you are in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, you may have the following rights in respect of your Personal Data, subject to the conditions and limitations set out in the GDPR:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Right of access (Art. 15):</strong> To obtain confirmation as to whether Personal Data is being Processed and to access it. Your data is held in the App on your device and, where iCloud sync is enabled, in your iCloud account.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to rectification (Art. 16):</strong> To have inaccurate Personal Data corrected. You may correct data directly in the App.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to erasure (Art. 17):</strong> To request erasure of your Personal Data (“right to be forgotten”). You may delete data in the App, uninstall the App, and/or remove data from your Apple ID / iCloud account.</li>

                <li><strong>Right to withdraw consent:</strong> Where Processing is based on consent, to withdraw consent at any time (e.g., by disabling iCloud sync or notifications in the App).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To exercise these rights or for any related inquiry, contact the Data Controller using the details in Section 13. We will respond within one month of a valid request, or inform you of any extension and the reasons therefor.</p>
            <p><strong>Right to lodge a complaint:</strong> You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in the EEA or UK. A list of EEA supervisory authorities is available at: <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en</a>.</p>

            <h2>11. Retention and Breach</h2>

            <h3>11.1 Retention</h3>
            <p>We do not retain User Data, as we do not store it. User Data remains solely on the User’s device and, where iCloud sync is enabled, on Apple’s iCloud infrastructure. Retention is determined by the User: data is removed from the device when deleted in the App or when the App is uninstalled; data on Apple’s infrastructure remains until the User deletes it via Apple ID settings.</p>

            <h3>11.2 Automated Decision-Making</h3>
            <p>We do not engage in automated decision-making or profiling within the meaning of Article 22 of the GDPR that produces legal effects concerning the User or similarly significantly affects the User. Features such as watering schedule calculations and “next due” dates are based on User-provided data and the device date and are performed locally on the device; they do not constitute such automated decision-making.</p>

            <h3>11.3 Personal Data Breach</h3>
            <p>In the event of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, we will, where required by applicable law:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Notify the competent supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach (as required under the GDPR for EEA/UK).</li>
                <li>Notify affected data subjects without undue delay where the breach is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms.</li>
                <li>Communicate the nature of the breach and the measures taken or proposed to address it.</li>

            <p>We do not operate servers or store User Data. All User Data remains on the User’s device or on Apple’s iCloud infrastructure (when sync is enabled). We therefore do not hold User Data that could be subject to a breach of our systems; the foregoing obligations apply only to the extent we Process or hold Personal Data.</p>
